# OCDS Toucan

OCDS Toucan is a web application for handling OCDS files based on [OCDS Kit](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocdskit).
OCDS Toucan provides the same functionalities as OCDS Kit through a intuitive and easy to use web interface.

## Getting Started 
### Requirements
1. Install [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads).
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the Github project.
3. Install [virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv). **Installation is optional, but recommended**. 

### Installation
1. Installing the projects dependencies:
```
pip intall -r requirements.txt
```
2. Set the following environment variables:
* OCDS_TOUCAN_MEDIA_ROOT: path of the directory where the uploaded files will be stored. Any directory of your choice
* OCDS_TOUCAN_LOCALE_PATH: path to the "locale" directory inside the project.
* OCDS_TOUCAN_MAXNUMFILES: max number of files to upload per request.
* OCDS_TOUCAN_MAXFILESIZE: max size of files to upload in bytes.

### Configuration 
The system can be configured by setting the environment variables mentioned above, some of this variables have
default values as shown in the following table

Restriction | Value | Environment Variables
--- | --- | ---
Maximun file size | 10MB | OCDS_TOUCAN_MAXFILESIZE
Maximun quantity of files per request | 20 | OCDS_TOUCAN_MAXNUMFILES

### Project deployment
Running the development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Functionalities
### Create Release Package
Generates a [Release Package](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/getting_started/publication_patterns/#packaging-releases-and-records) from many [Release](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/getting_started/releases_and_records/#releases) files.
Uses the command `package-releases`. [More Information](https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/ocds.html#package-releases).
>Valid file types: [Release](/tests/fixtures/1.1/releases).

### Combine Packages
Combines release packages or record packages into a single package.		
Uses the command `combine-record-packages` for record packages. [More information](https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/ocds.html#combine-record-packages).	
Uses the command `combine-release-packages` for release packages. [More information](https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/ocds.html#combine-release-packages).
>Valid file types: [Release Packages](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages), [Record Packages](/tests/fixtures/1.1/record-packages).

### Compile Releases
Generates a [Record Package](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/getting_started/publication_patterns/#packaging-releases-and-records) from Release Package files.
Uses the command `compile`. **Attention**: this command uses `--package` and `--versioned` as parameters, visit the [documentation](https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/ocds.html#compile) for more information. 
>Valid file types: [Release Packages](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages).

### Upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1
Updates packages and releases from OCDS version 1.0 to 1.1.
Uses the command `upgrade`. [More information](https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/ocds.html#upgrade).
>Valid file types: Any OCDS file.

### Generate a spreadsheet version of schema
Generates a spreadsheet of any OCDS schema version.
Uses the command `mapping-sheet`. [More Information](https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/schema.html#mapping-sheet).
>Valid file types: [Release](/tests/fixtures/1.1/releases), [Release Packages](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages) o [Record Packages](/tests/fixtures/1.1/record-packages).

### Convert to CSV/Excel
Converts a Release Package file to a CSV/Excel version.
Uses [flatten-tool](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool).
>Valid file types: [Release Packages](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages).

### Convert to JSON
Converts a CSV or Excel file extension into a release package.	
Uses [flatten-tool](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool).
>Valid file types: [Release Packages](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages).

## Architecture
### Architectures Description
This web application use Django Framework to build Front-end and Backend modules.
The Front-end module contains the user-interaction elements.
In the Back-end module, the OCDS Kit and flatten-tool are implemented as libraries that implement the functionalities.

Restriction|Value
--- | ---
Maximun file size | 10MB
Maximun quantity of files per request | 20
Session timeout | 24 hours

## Use examples

The screenshots used in the differet following examples correspond to how the different functionalities look in the website as of
april 2020

### 1. Create a Release Package
1. Select a file with "Add a file" or by dragging it to the rectangle. We will be using [Release 1.1](/tests/fixtures/1.1/releases) files.
![Alt text](img/ex1_1.png "Image 1.1")
2. Add more files with the "Add more files"(2.1) button or create a Release Package with "Start" (2.2). 
![Alt text](img/ex1_2.png "Image 1.2")
3. When finished, a message will appear to download the generated Release Packaged.
![Alt text](img/ex1_3.png "Image 1.3")

### 2. Combine Packages

#### 2.1 Release Package
1. For this example we selected the Release Package option in the Package type dropdown list.
2. Select one or more Release Package files with "Add a file" or by dragging to the rectangle. In this example we use the [Release Packages 1.1](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages) files.
![Alt text](img/ex2_1.png "Image 2.1.2")
3. We can add more files with the "Add more files" button or by dragging to the rectangle, or we can start the operation with "Start".
![Alt text](img/ex2_2.png "Image 2.1.3")
4. Once finished, a message will appear to download the generated file.

### 2.2 Record Package
1. For this example we selected the Record Package option in the Package type dropdown list.
2. Select one or more Release Package files with "Add a file" or by dragging to the rectangle. In this example we use the [Record Packages 1.1](/tests/fixtures/1.1/record-packages) files.

### 3. Compile Release Packages
1. Select a file with "Add a file" or by dragging to the rectangle, just as the first example. We will use the [Release Packages 1.1](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages) examples.
2. Just as the example before, we can add more files or start  the operation. We also have the option to include Release versioning on our Record Package that will be generated.
![Alt text](img/ex3_1.png "Image 3.1")
3. Just as the example before, a message to download the generated Record Package appears.
![Alt text](img/ex3_2.png "Image 3.2")

### 4. Update a 1.0 OCDS file to 1.1
1. Select one or more Release/Record Package version 1.0 files. For this example we will be using [this](/tests/fixtures/1.0/release-packages/0001-tender.json) test file.
2. We can add more 1.0 files or start the conversion.
3. Once finished, a message will appear to download the updated files.

### 5. Generate a spreadsheed version of a OCDS schema
1. Select the schema type and the version to generate. In this example we will be using a Release Package Schema 1.1.
![Alt text](img/ex5.png "Image 5")
2. A file with .csv extention will be generated, and automatically dowloaded

### 6. Convert a Release Package to .csv
1. Select the Release Package to convert. Only one can be uploaded. We will be using [this](/tests/fixtures/1.1/release-packages/0002-tender.json) test file.
2. Two files will be generated, a .xlsx file and a compressed file with .csv files, that contain data from the Release Package.
![Alt text](img/ex6.png "Image 6")

### 7. Convert to JSON
1. Select the file with .csv or .xlsx extention to convert. For multiple .csv files, compress them in .zip format. For this example we use [this](/tests/fixtures/1.1/spreadsheets/flattened.csv) file. 
![Alt text](img/ex7_1.png "Image 7.1")
2. After selecting the file, click the "Start" button to start the operation.
